# MOV to MP4 Converter

This Python script easily converts video files from `.MOV` format to `.MP4` format, maintaining the original file's name but changing its extension. The script utilizes the `moviepy` library to handle the conversion process efficiently. This tool is perfect for users looking to convert videos for compatibility with different devices or media players that prefer the `.MP4` format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the `moviepy` library is required. If you don't have `moviepy` installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install moviepy
```

### Installation

No installation is necessary for the script itself. Simply ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed on your system.

### Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure your `.MOV` file is accessible to the script.
3. Modify the `mov_file_path` variable in the script to point to your `.MOV` file's location.
4. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python mov_to_mp4_converter.py
```

The script will automatically create an `.MP4` version of the file in the same directory as the original, retaining the original file name but changing the extension to `.MP4`.

## Features

- **Easy Conversion**: Convert `.MOV` files to `.MP4` with a single command.
- **Automatic File Naming**: The output file retains the original file's name, only changing the extension to `.MP4`.
- **In-Place Conversion**: The converted file is saved in the same location as the input file.
