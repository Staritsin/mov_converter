1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
 we call that regularization when we are

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,400
 turning or estimates towards some value.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,000
 It's zero, for instance.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,599
 We see that customer two in red,

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,400
 it's like confidence interval on zero height

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,599
 that we will dive here.

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,800
 And it's not in the same range as we will dive

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,000
 if we looked only at customer two.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,600
 So this model is ready,

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,400
 but estimating several arcs together

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,000
 and pulling the estimates.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
 And what's interesting as well is that at the top you see

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,199
 we have like a confidence interval

14
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:36,199
 on the third party itself.

15
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:39,399
 And that's in the version modeling.

16
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,600
 It's derived from what we call the prior distribution.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
 And it's just a way to model the third party

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 on its own and saying,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,399
 OK, what's the estimate we have

20
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,399
 for the error rate of this third party

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,799
 given all the data we are observing right now.

22
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,599
 And from that we can build another thing system.
