# Video Tools
A collection of python scripts to make minor edits to video files.


I'll explain more about these python scripts soon. 

Ther are 5 scripts that perform the following: 

- [Clip (clip.py)](clip.py) - Clip off a time frame from a video. Used to remove the first 4 seconds of dead air in a video.
- [Upscale (upscale.py)](upscale.py) - Process a video to a different resolution. Used to upscale a 1080 x 720 video to 1920 x 1020 version.
- [Shorten (shorten.py)](shorten.py) - Using an array with time stamps of portions of the video you wish to keep and remove everything else. This is used to remove unnecessary sections of a video but requires the user to document the start and stop times of each section to keep.
- [2xSpeed (2XSpeed.py)](2xSpeed.py) - Double the speed of the video. Used to shorten videos in half but still be understandable.
- [Make gif (make_gif.py)](make_gif.py) - Convert video to a gif. Note: the file size is often larger than the video source.
